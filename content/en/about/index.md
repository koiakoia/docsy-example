Haist IT Consulting was founded with a straightforward mission: to provide reliable, expert IT support and guidance to the businesses that form the backbone of our Wabash County community. With deep roots in Wabash through the Haist family, we understand the importance of trust, dependable service, and local partnership.

We bring not only years of professional IT expertise but also a genuine understanding of the day-to-day operational challenges faced by small businesses, including direct experience within the restaurant industry. This allows us to offer practical, effective technology solutions that are tailored to your specific needs, not just generic fixes. Our passion for technology, demonstrated by a commitment to robust and well-managed systems (much like a meticulously maintained homelab), translates into high-quality service for our clients.
